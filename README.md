# Relative Positioning
Relative positioning is a method to find objects in the sky based on objects easily found(like the moon) in a equatorial mount telescope. The origin of the scales is usually set at the poles, with this method the pole isn't needed for positioning. It's still needed for aligment of the telescope though.

# The app
This focuses on using a different approach to locate objects in the sky: instead of using the scales to match an object's coordinates, the scale origin is set to be in the object itself, so the scale reading is the relative distance between the origin object and the desired one.
